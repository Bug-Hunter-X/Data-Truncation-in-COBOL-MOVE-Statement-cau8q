This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, bug in COBOL programs: data truncation during MOVE operations.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.cob` shows the corrected version.  Improper handling of data lengths can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug issues in production environments. Ensure your COBOL programs carefully handle data length compatibility to avoid unexpected truncation and data corruption.
